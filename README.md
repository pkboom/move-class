# Move classes

If you move classes to another namespace, so you have to change a namespace manually. If you use `phpstorm`, you can do this easily. But if you use `vscode` like me, you have to do it all manually. This package can help you with that, changing `namespaces` accordingly.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require pkboom/move-class
```

## Usage

Move files and folders and run:

```bash
$ move-class
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
